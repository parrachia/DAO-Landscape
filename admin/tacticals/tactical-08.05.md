# Tactical 08.05

## Updates:

* Felipe: showing [the institution proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/181cmsfvhaW88IncQ3tlZj-ne2QVtlqbM-0RsDazfd2Q/edit) – principles, forms etc.
* Grace: finished [the research](https://ecosystem.daoincubator.org/gendao/research-wg/research-on-search-engine-for-proposals   ) – found no conflicting research. It was arbitrary, there was a lot of categories
* Phil: have a lot of info to process now, reiterating – surprising to see these proposal and perspectives. Want to investigate / describe DAOs from different perspectives. Maybe DAO incubator is the right place. Realized this work going on. Trying to see where is the best place to do that. Intended to do not just paid work, don't care how it would be branded. Want to create educational content – so people can understand it. If people are interested we can setup some process. In some of the gitbooks – was plant with sprints with delivery in June..
* Max: discussed the Glossary with Phil a bit, network case studies – no major updates, DAO stack has launched a\) forum topic with resources on how to build DAOs b\) telegram group to deliver this effort

## Max / Funding status

Any update on the funding?

Felipe: that's what my prop is about, for 18 ETH. The proposal is still in draft.

## Felipe / 3 different perspectives

3 different directions have shown up:

* mechanism for decentralized mapping for the ecosystem \(more interest in position\) – who and where
* define DAO dimensions and make solid conclusions – what and why
* education and instrumentation – how

Max: aligned. Inform the community & wider blockchain audience on

* knowledge for to-be-DAOs \(e.g. best practices on things like proposal making\)
* interoperability gaps

Phil: listed DAOs dimensions to analyze them. Yellow pages – idea was no to talk about legal or mech design, but list DAOs and research them from different angles. Bring smth that is not existent. List things like Moloch and review stakes from legal or tech implementation \(e.g. JS + Aragon\). What is important – upgradeability of Aragon.

Felipe: more clear. Somebody needs to make a decisive movement towards funding.

## Felipe / Funding movement

Please review / comment the proposal or make another proposal

## Max / Plan

Presented the plan – WDYT and readiness to contribute.

Grace: happy to contribute existent work. This is not my main work, but can take some assignments

Phil: don't know the week numbers, maybe use the dates. Have no idea of the relevance of this work. Very ambitious. When I look in what's inside – it's too thin. If the team is 4 people on the call right now it feel like not enough/realistic. Suggest: don't know how executing this plan fit Felipe's proposal. Is it independent? Suggested another plan: framing things a bit differently.

Felipe: 3 plans are super complementary, need to put size that will fit Genesis. If I could raise $300k – we can achieve all. My plan is a starting point. Agree that eve 6-7 people is not enough, especially with other commitments. Create social dymanics with bounties. There're 9 DAOs there – we need to find smth that will scale.

## Grace / Report

Had fun – read the report and provide feedback. There wasn't trends, we have no mech to analyze that. With new platform we'll loose the connection with the prev info. Made some suggestion about that. If nonbody makes it organized, it can come to manual work.

Felipe: it's the mega issue, immediately raised with Pedro – he's working on that strategy. Want create a living thing.

Grace: the biggest problem is onboarding, feeling a newbie even after 3 months. I want quickly write the proposal and go. People loose interest and don't know why that is. That's how I do things. It's difficult. The org is not designed, we need to get it cut to increments.

Felipe: we're trying to make this marriage work, when we've breaken it down to smaller elements – we can start work. We need to have more than a 0 in the middle. At least beers.

Grace: where's the money going, am wondering if we have $20k and 100 people, then maybe it leads to boring meetings and not leds to proposals.

Phil: sounds like a great medium article.

Felipe: created a lot and not afraid to request big budgets. So may be not tru for everyone.

## Closing round

Felipe: want to see a proposal / doable one. Meeting was most energetic and fun of all

Grace: interesting, think that i need to focus on the proposal, would like specific assignments. All of us coming to a conclusion to support own interest proposals. 

Phil: was super interesting, definitely will read again Felipes proposal and will follow up. Also Grace's report. And still don't know what to do with my proposal. Maybe will find a way to tight that with Felipe's. \(Felipe – put it to DAOstack right away, would like to help you\).

Max: got some motivation, conflict is productive.
