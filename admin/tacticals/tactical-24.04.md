# Tactical 24.04

Projects updates:

* Genesis campaign \(Pedro\) – there are 2 different proposals, 1 passed for warm-up work \(me and Grace\). Other proposal is close to be ready. Initial findings – many efforts, initiative in Genesis and other that could benefit from the comprehensive landscape mapping. Working on taxonomy, one of the things that helped to identify what I just described. Found loose and insights, that would go into comprehensive long writing.

### Max / What do we present on Jun 1st, Work distribution & commitments

Do we still do this till Jun 1?

Andreas: Felipe's idea was to break it down to smaller proposals. We cannot publish all ideas before jun1. Besides the time the amount of work can’t be funded inside that scope. It’s way too big already and growing. We’re just talking about the proposals. We’ve done some research already, e.g. taxonomy. Consolidating the research, max – case studies, grace – daos and challenges, andreas – map. Structure design.

Pedro: understanding that scrum framework will help us a lot, by applying to use the project we’ll have fixed time and budget but variable scope. Will try to fit as much scope as reasonably possible.

Dani: agree we need to go for visual representation, followed by longer efforts

What’s be done by next call \(in 2 weeks\):

* Max – Network governance case studies, soft governance maybe
* Daniel – Legal
* Pedro - Glossary
* no further actions before funded

### Max / Feedback on network governance piece

### Pedro / genDAO passed proposal

done in the project’s updates  


### Beth / Beth’s Research

Spoke yesterday – clarified a bit, research by computational law, token engineering and else. Am thinking through the functional taxonomy of DAOs. What type of function of the DAO is performing, is it acting as a legal structure or priority of importance. There’s debate happening where people DAOs shouldn’t be the plutocracy. People are sure what DAO shouldn't be, but not clear what it is. Chaos engineering method, gov shouldn’t have majority leadership but in DAO it is what happens. 1.5 weeks for the exercise.

Chapter on Taxonomy

Have a look and give feedback by the end of the week

### Daniel / I wanna understand what is the structure of this  is this funded/unfunded genesis effort, a dgov+daoinc collab? something else? 

Andreas: Maybe provide Dani [a sheet with the scope.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SAFyTSH-pwzI_qHEFRETCEM3S2d4b0ROBSFQtX4XVao/edit#gid=0)

Pedro will follow up with Dani, Beth and Phil to share the progress.

Overall it’s the independent group of researchers.
