# Tactical \#1

Industry Landscape 18.03.2019  


### Max / Intro  / Research Goals

#### Grace / how we started that

Was researching it, Pedro was looking on that for longer, then Ela. Pat became interested from the other POV – let’s see what already done. My goal was search engine about all proposals in the dgov, DAO space. Maybe somebody on DASH did it \(and failed\). E.g. topics on identity, voting. Pat was interested in the spreadsheet of DAOs and what they use \(e.g. voting, legal model etc\). Good in org design and interviewing.

#### Andreas

The experiment started in Berlin as an entrepreneur. Not a researcher as well, but done a lot of market analysis, that I did with mapping. Come from sharing economy, platform coops. Through Ela, started to work with rchain/dgov. Besides, that was researching 50-60 providers from the map, the goal was in identifying challenges and how to integrate them in the ecosystem. Would like to continue with that proposal. The only question is to what degree dgov~DAO are related. Dgov are the tools for organizing people, the step before DAO. You need some rules at the start. Maybe that’s one component of the research.

#### Pedro

Feel the need to give some context. Now blockchain researcher in R&D / Applied research, part of Genesis DAO since inception. Worked with NGOs on multiple areas. Most interested in knowledge production – trying to help somehow another attempt in the research DAO \(Matan tried to launch\). It didn’t really happen, there were talks with EF and other entities about more agnostic initiative. That would be an amazing step to that. Invited Felipe. Remembered [https://viz.envisioning.io/democracy/?o=2](https://viz.envisioning.io/democracy/?o=2) – maybe a useful tool

#### Felipe

Org consultant, as Phoebe, in Brazil. Very VUCA, Occupy movement veteran and other movements. Used to conflict. Am a painter and artists. Interested in creating cybernetics relations, what we create here is super linked. Have some drafts. Let’s imagine all info on blockchain was collected in the space form / orbits \(can send more info\). Would be very important to see knowledge, so other people can get the info in a visual way. Have beedn in Asia, coming back in 2 weeks, let’s hangout. Am DAO stack team comms & community. Finishing the book. Reading “Walkway” – blows my mind.  


#### Max

Dgov, dao incubator. A book before the conference. Understanding what’s happening  
  


### Max / Methodology

* Dgov wiki
* Andreas map
* Pedro map

## Should we make a research first?

Pedro: Blockchain is essential for web 3.0, for capabilities. Taking a step to look around existent efforts, looking for good / avoiding bad redundancy. We don’t need to spend a lot of time on that but start or do simultaneously.

Felipe: can’t understand between a search engine and pieces of info.

Grace: It looked like a map, but we needed to check if nobody else does it.

Andreas: know how well it is, to do it at the start, From the work i’ve done – there’s no consolidated research. That’s why what we’re doing is great.

Felipe: the main thing is how to activate the collective intelligence, we’ll run in the issue of Taxonomy. Then friction and what’s the mode of collaboration.

Grace: what friction am I solving?

Felipe: a map is a way to come from A to B, with information points. A map is an easier way to go, so you remove the friction. It’s easy to understand the friction from the persona/task.

Grace: there’re 2 perceptions of where this work is going. If i’m running/starting a DAO – what are the practices that people used successfully / unsuccessfully. So I can look in their examples.

The other is to look at us as an industry – what interoperability we need. It’s well known if it’s a business. So in this new realm – what it should be \(identity, token etc\). What are the interfaces?

Pedro: to simplify we can think in desired outcomes. One way is a “report” – simplify interaction. Show how things are going up until now. And we can consider how to make it dynamic, but that would be something accomplished. And then we can do a community extension.

Felipe: support.  


Andreas: If all information for a map are centralised, you’re a bottleneck – it’s hard. On the other hand, collaborative maps are not easy to programm. I like the idea of the report limited by a date.  


Pedro: yeah – as a stable version.

## Max / Structure & Distribution of work

How people like to participate.

* Glossary \(e.g. What is DAO, who is DAO\) – Max, Andreas
* Model \(How does it all stick together: dgov, dao, on-/off-chain, … all the buzzwords in the space\) – Andreas with support of ...?
* [On-chain Governance Case Studies](https://wiki.dgov.foundation/resources/protocol-governance-case-studies) – Max
* Table of what DAOs use \(identity etc\) – Grace
* Industry landscape \(service providers, vc, hubs …\) – Max, Andreas, Grace
* Map of DAOs / Taxonomy – Andreas, Felipe,
* DAO Challenges \(based on Interviews with the projects\) – Andreas, Max, Grace, Phoebe
* Infographics of models – Felipe, Grace

We can break down on smaller proposals and also see what people need to be paid.

## Closing round

Grace: want to create a set of the proposal and understand the payment and submit the first props. Even if submitted done – it’s ok to get funds for it

Andreas: support + understand what people are ready to contribute in terms of time.

Pedro: we need to agree on decision-making mechanism, for roadmap etc. Regarding roles. Interacting on low bandwith first, maybe in sprint mode. Starting working like that first can help get funds. Also a chat / task board maybe.

Felipe: -

Max: fixed amount, editor/curator, further async comms in chat or loomio
