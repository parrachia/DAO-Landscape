## **Dorg**

Software development DAO.


### **Purpose of governance system**



*   Management and distribution of funds to the participants in the DAO


### **Technology used**



*   Identity: Metamask/DAOstack identity
*   Communication: Public Discord group and Members-only Discord group. Jitsy, telegram, zoom and hangouts meetings.
*   Proposals: Members-only Github repository
*   Voting: DAOstack
*   Reputation: DAOstack


### **Reason we chose that technology**

Aragon had more rules that were similar to a c-corp, whereas DAOstack allowed more customization and ability to build on top of the platform. Focus of DAOstack on scalability was a plus. Founder Ori Shimoni: “We prefer scalable efficient kibbutzes rather than unstoppable Delaware C-Corps. That’s a bit of an unconscious bias.” (Not sure how they define unconscious, because they said it out loud.)


### **Governed objects and mechanisms**



*    Contracts entered into by dOrg
*    Work payment  and budget allocation of dOrg
*    Membership in dOrg

**Membership:**

dOrg the first BBLLC under Vermont law, meaning it is a legal entity defined as a DAO and through the DAO technology. Under this law, the member individuals are the members in the DAO. When someone joins the online DAOstack implementation, they are automatically part of the legal entity, and no further requirements or filings need to be met.

**Proposals:**

dOrg is a software development house, primarily focused on doing work on DAO technology. Companies and other entities contract dOrg to do development work.

No contract signed by a member of dOrg is valid until it is passed by a vote on the dOrg DAOstack implementation. The sales representative of dOrg signs on the agreement with an outside company, but the contract stipulates that it comes into force only by being voted as approved in the dOrg DAO.

**Reputation and voting:**

Voting is weighted based on the individuals’ reputation in dOrg. Reputation in dOrg is accumulated based on the participation in dOrg. From that perspective, dOrg views reputation as more of a representation of “ownership” or “shares”. The more work someone does as part of dOrg, the more reputation that person carries. The team views this as a fair system, representing the amount of time each person has invested in the company.

**Fund allocation:**

The team members have job descriptions and assignments to specific roles in the organization.



*    Each member has workstreams they are assigned, and they document the work that they plan to do. Each workstream has a monthly budget and 1-3 people working on the workstream. Workstreams and the members’ proposals for work are **NOT** governed on the DAO.
*   Every 2 weeks, each dOrg member reports on what they accomplished in that 2-week sprint, and requests their payment in a closed proposal in the Github repository. (All proposals are closed for confidentiality of the participants and clients of dOrg.)
*   The team votes immediately, such that almost all of the proposals are passed with a 50% or more majority the same day they are posted, and each person is paid immediately. This may not be scalable to larger organizations, especially because each person would have to vote on every other person’s salary. The boosting mechanism in DAOstack would end up making this payment process a bit slow, but dOrg felt that even a 3-day delay would not be a major lag for most participants.
