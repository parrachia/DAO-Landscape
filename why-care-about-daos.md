# Why DAO?

## What is DAO \(Decentralized Autonomous Organization\)?

Let's start with identifying the essence of DAOs by different influencers in the field.

DAO is an entity that lives on the internet and exists autonomously, but also heavily relies on hiring individuals to perform certain tasks that the automaton itself cannot do \[[Vitalik Buterin](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)\].

DAO means ownership + Distributed Governance system. \(Matan Field, in COALA conversations\)

DAO is a corporation running on the digital jurisdiction. \(Yalda, EthCC presentation\)

A DAO can be seen as the most complex form of a smart contract, where the bylaws of the decentralized organization are embedded into the code of the smart contract, using complex token governance rules. \([Blockchain Hub](https://blockchainhub.net/dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization/)\)

The DAO \(specifically\) was an organization that was designed to be automated and decentralized. \([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/)\)

DAO is a fancy way of saying a digital system living on Ethereum. \([Richard Burton, Balance](https://medium.com/balance-io/why-open-source-finance-will-win-a1f3a61544c2)\)

DAO is a composition of smart contracts running on the underlying permissionless blockchain \(e.g. Ethereum\) to form an organisation infrastructure. \(Tim Bansemer\).

DAO – An organization that runs autonomously, in a decentralized manner, that functions without the need for centralized parties to make decisions for the organization to grow, to be profitable, or \*physically\* exist to serve its overall purpose. A DAO can be an on-chain contract, or a series of on-chain contracts that interoperate to complete some greater organizational function. \([Steven McKie](https://medium.com/amentum/the-year-of-the-dao-comeback-9c888b44980)\)

DAC \(Decentralized autonomous corporations/companies\) are a smaller topic, because they are basically a subclass of DAOs, but they are worth mentioning. Since the main exponent of DAC as terminology is Daniel Larimer, we will borrow as a definition the point that he himself consistently promotes: DAC is the DAO that pays dividends \[[source](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)\].

### Collectivization/Humanitarian benefits

* Enables collective intelligence
* Is owned by people driven by purpose \(e.g. fighting climate change or maintaining commons\)
* Resistant to corruption
* Open, Permissionless & Unbiased
* Better social justice, democratic governance

### Automation benefits

* Increase efficiency by Removing Managerial Waste
* Scalable alignment with incentives
* AI extension possibilities / digital organisms
* Non-censorable, unstoppable
