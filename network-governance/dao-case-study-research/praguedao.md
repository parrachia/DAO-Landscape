# PragueDAO

PragueDAO created a co-working space with the management structure of a DAO. The purpose of the DAO was to allow coworking members to determine the use of discretionary funds that were the profit of the DAO. While PragueDAO did generate interest in the space as a co-working space, the startups who came to the space were not interested in the self-governing aspect. The startups tended to see that as one more task they would have to do, and did not see the advantage of the DAO for them.

Launching of the physical space required significant up-front costs.

Currently the PragueDAO founders are investigating different business models around startup ecosystems for the DAO. Officially, this is a pivot rather than a failure of the initial idea of the DAO.
