# CuraDAO

CuraDAO is working to create a collaborative framework for funding community projects IRL in Curacao

### Purpose of governance system

*  Financing public good projects, starting with smaller projects in Curacao.
* Combatting corruption.
*  Making it easier to start a business.

### Technology used

Communications: Meetups IRL, Facebook groups

DAOstack

### Reason we chose that technology

* Ability to give people an identity and allow them to participate without the need for official documentation.
* We liked the direction and believe the structure is scalable.
* Reputation is important in our system.

### Governed objects and mechanisms:

* Currently still under experimentation. We are using the DAOstack features to allow people to propose and raise money for their projects.
* Discussion is on Facebook.
