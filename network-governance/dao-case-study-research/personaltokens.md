# Personaltokens

People can create their own personal tokens and send them as bonus/rewards to anyone who they want to reward.

### Purpose of governance system:

* Management and distribution of the utility token of the system.
* Utility token governance is like corporate governance.

### Technology used

Communication: Telegram

Voting: Aragon, 1-token-1-vote

No identity solution.

### Reason we chose that technology

* Aragon was the most developed frontend technology when we launched.

### Governed objects and mechanisms:

* We govern the distribution of the utility token of Personaltoken. Distribution of voting power so people can’t dump tokens.
* Membership in decision making now is 6 founders and advisors of the team. Considering criteria for having others join the DAO group.
* Proposal was made to freeze tokens for vesting, but that is being heavily tested before implementation because once it’s implemented, it can’t be reversed.
* Anyone \(inside or outside voting group\) can make a proposal.
* Proposals are made for development and marketing/promotion of the platform.
* Once someone posts a proposal they begin to campaign for the proposal on the telegram group.
* Voting is 1-person-1-vote.
