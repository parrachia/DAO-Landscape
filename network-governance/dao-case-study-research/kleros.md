# Kleros

### Purpose of governance system:

Two governance systems:

* Built-in jury system for dispute resolution \(not described here\)
* Governance of the code base / the system itself

### Technology used

* Communications: Offchain forum
* Voting: Aragon
* Enforcement: Developing proprietary system to convert “human language” decisions to code, so that they will be able to auto execute.
* Dispute resolution: Proprietary Kleros

### Reason we chose that technology

* Aragon was the available technology at that time. 

### Governed objects and mechanisms:

* Code changes
* Anyone can make a proposal. Usually the proposals are not subject to much discussion, because they are technical in nature and most of the community doesn’t care
* When a proposal comes for voting, Kleros issues 1 voting token for each Kleros token. This way it is one-token-one-vote, but people do not have to stake or withdraw their Kleros tokens. These one-time tokens are good only for the specific proposal voting for which they were issued.
* The issuance of the voting token is done in a transparent way, so that the tokens are issued, but the user doesn’t see them as tokens. Users just vote on the proposal.
* Proposals are in human language. Kleros is developing tools that will allow for conversion of human-described decisions into code that can auto-execute.
