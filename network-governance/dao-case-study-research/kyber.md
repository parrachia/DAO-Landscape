# Kyber

Liquidity protocol for decentralized exchange of tokens. 

### Purpose of governance system

Allocation of a small \($5000\) marketing and outreach budget.

### Technology used

* Communication: Telegram chats
* Voting and reputation: DAOstack

### Reason we chose that technology

Relationship, trying out new technology

### Governed objects and mechanisms

* Kyber allocated a budget for distribution through the DAOstack platform.
* Community members made proposals for distribution of the funds, approved proposals were funded through the DAO.

With a small budget, the organization was able to fund a variety of initiatives, including community managers and outreach in countries where they did not have representation.

Generally the experiment was a success, gathering a tremendous amount of publicity for the organization and generating more marketing benefits than would normally have been available with such a small budget.

The main organization is still managed in a traditional centralized manner by the founders of Kyber, and the organization plans are to do additional experiments with DAO funding following the success of the experiment.

### Findings

Detailed suggestions were submitted to DAOstack. Summaries are found in the [Findings section ](findings-september-october-2019.md)of this document, collated with the similar suggestions from others.
